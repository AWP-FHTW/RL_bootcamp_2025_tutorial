# RL Bootcamp 2025

Welcome to **RL Bootcamp 2025**! This repository is a companion resource for the RL Bootcamp, a hands-on, beginner-friendly introduction to **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** using Python. Whether you're an absolute novice or looking to solidify your understanding of RL, this bootcamp is designed to help you gain both foundational concepts and practical experience.

---

## üë• Who is This For?

This bootcamp is ideal for:
- Students and professionals keen to get started with Reinforcement Learning.
- Learners with basic Python skills and an interest in machine learning or AI.
- Anyone who enjoys hands-on, project-based learning.

No prior experience in RL is required!

---

## üéØ What Will You Learn?

By completing this bootcamp, you will:
- Understand the core ideas behind Reinforcement Learning, including agents, environments, states, actions, and rewards.
- Get hands-on practice with classic RL algorithms such as Q-learning and Policy Gradients.
- Develop RL agents that can learn through trial and error in simulated environments.
- Explore popular Python libraries for RL (e.g., Gymnasium/OpenAI Gym, NumPy, and others).
- Build intuition for how RL is applied in games, robotics, control, and real-world problems.

---

## üõ† Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** installed on your computer.
- Basic knowledge of Python programming (functions, loops, classes).
- Curiosity about AI, learning, and experimentation!

## üèóÔ∏è Bootcamp Structure

The course is structured into progressive lessons, each building foundational knowledge and practical skills:
1. **Introduction to Reinforcement Learning**: Concepts and terminology.
2. **Environments & Agents**: How RL tasks are modeled.
3. **Basic RL Algorithms**: Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradients, and more.
4. **Exploring Python RL Libraries**: Getting started with Gymnasium/OpenAI Gym and others.
5. **Hands-on Projects**: Apply your knowledge in coding exercises and mini-projects.

Each lesson includes clear explanations, annotated code examples, readings, and exercises to reinforce your understanding.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To begin:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure you have [Python 3.12+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
3. Set up a virtual environment (recommended):

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv rl-bootcamp-env
   source rl-bootcamp-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: rl-bootcamp-env\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install any required packages (see instructions or requirements in the course materials).

Check each lesson's notebook or script for additional setup instructions as you progress.
